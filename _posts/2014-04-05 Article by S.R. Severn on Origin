        <p>I always think it doesn’t hurt for a writer to share their writing experience with others so they can come to understand the process and steps involved to producing a good piece of material. Due to this belief I ended up publishing an article about my journey on Tales From The Woods, an online magazine surrounding all forms of roots music and other contributing talent. <br/>
        Below is my full two page article and Keith Wood’s introductory piece to my article from the latest issue of TFTW magazine which can be read at <a href="http://www.tftw.org.uk/upload/TFTW78.pdf">  http://www.tftw.org.uk/upload/TFTW78.pdf</a><br/>

        [Sabrina is a new talented writer that TFTW is introducing to our loyal readers. Fresh out of Greenwich University after taking a degree in creative writing, she has bravely self-published her first novel. In the words of a highly successful author with fourteen crime fiction novels behind him "Glover Wright" otherwise known as Buddy Britten, Rock’n’Roll singer and guitarist of whom many of us may be more familiar, feels that Sabrina has a great future ahead as an author. I suggested that she may like to write an article about her first novel and how her love of the written word came to be, to which she kindly agreed. So, without further ado from me, I’ll hand over to Sabrina. - Keith Woods]

        When Keith Woods gave me the opportunity to write an article about my writing experience following the recent publication of my novel Origin, I was elated. So I would like to start with introducing myself, I’m S.R. Severn and I’m the author of the new series The Jackson J Tales.
        <br/><br/>
        I don’t recall the specific moment I realised that I wanted to be an author. That’s something that came with age and experience. As a child I remember being obsessed with books, especially books with a lot of imagery. At the time I would draw and copy those pictures as a means of expression but I hadn’t actually tried writing. 
        <br/><br/>
        My real knack for writing definitely began in secondary school.  I was suddenly thrown into a world of literature and language, poetry and essays. And I enjoyed it, immensely. When I was thirteen I wrote a book based on my friends and set in an alternative fantasy called Lost Ties (The Reincarnated Chronicles). This was my first ever achievement yet I never published it until November 2010. Before this, I was just known at school as ‘the girl who carries that large white folder everywhere’. During this venture, my English teacher persuaded me to enter a poetry competition, which I did. My poem was then later added into an anthology and before I knew it I had another published and another.
        <br/><br/>
        In university, I studied English Creative writing and it was the best three years of my life. This was where my passion for writing had been put to the test. It was possibly the most stressful yet most knowledgeable experience I’ve had. Learning to accept constructive criticism and amend my work was definitely a hard learnt lesson and I appreciate the trials and tests that came with it. I was able to analyse my work and openly criticize and admit when something wasn’t working.
        <br/><br/>
        As a creative writer, I was exposed to a number of different subjects within my course. I have experience in stage and screen writing, performance writing, article writing and review writing. After University I began writing Origin for fun. Initially, it had set out to be just a short experimentation due to my interest in paranormal romance. But as the months progressed I found this short curiosity has started to develop and grow into a series.
        <br/><br/>
        Late 2013, I decided to go into the deep end and focus on getting Origin published. Of course that meant I needed to go over the book and flesh out my characters as well as work on my plot. For four months I managed to achieve this by listening to a range of music for inspiration. My preferences for music has to be alternative metal, symphonic metal and Christian rock bands like Skillet, Evanescence, Within Temptation, 30 Seconds to Mars, Fireflight and Linkin Park. More so, I love Dubstep. To some, it’s just noise but I love the mash of a good beat combined with one of my favourite songs.
        <br/><br/>
        Rock helped with the process of writing Origin because of the world the story is set in. The world is a gothic mix of old Victorian Britain and scientific/steam industrialized civilisation. It is very much a time inspired by Steampunk. Dubstep and hard metal helped with the fast-paced action scenes; Christian rock assisted me in the darker themes of the book –- like death, betrayal and helplessness while alternative rock set the mood for those passionate, heart-felt, nail-biting erotic scenes.
        <br/><br/>
        Re-working Origin was very fun as well as very challenging. There were days where I wouldn’t sleep because I was so focused. Most of the time I ended up having episodes of great unease and insecurity where I would feel to rip out my hair because I felt my writing was nonsense. That’s the hardship of a writer. Every writer has their doubts about their ability -- about their ideas. I reckon all writers are vulnerable because they are exposing their imaginings to a world of criticism. But without the constructive criticism a writer struggles to grow, improve and learn.
        <br/><br/>
        I battled with myself for days, changing the simplest of words and threatened to scrap the plot and start a whole new one. As it was a self published project, I had no real deadline to reach but my own personal one. The closer I began to reach it, the more I would have a mixture of excitement and fear rolling around my stomach. But when I wrote the final closing paragraph I was beyond accomplished. It felt like I had saved the world by disarming a bomb in the nick of time!
        <br/><br/>
        I hadn’t counted on the publishing process to be so long and so torturing for me. I had to proof read 676 pages about four times when I received my first ever proof copy and was stunned to find so many errors I missed by staring at a computer screen for days. With the corrections I made, I also had my friend and designer change the cover for me. 
        <br/>
Upon receiving my second proof copy, I was beyond anxious about what the final product would look like. Would the cover come out alright? Would I find a typo on the first page? So many questions and fears. But when I did open the package and clamped eyes on my second proof, I fell in love.  It was then did I realise just how hard I had worked and just how much of an achievement it was to get a book published. 
        <br/><br/>
        I approved the book on CreateSpace (an Amazon Company for Independent Publishing) and then my book went live on Amazon Kindle and all Amazon sites around the world. I felt like a new mother watching her baby go to school for the first time. It was an overwhelming feeling. Promotion had been another hurdle and still continues to be but I hope that in time, those who have read Origin, would be able to come back with feedback for curious readers.
        <br/><br/>
        I still get a great deal of support and encouragement from friends and colleagues who have a copy of my book and I am grateful for their enthusiasm. If I have to impart a word of advice for those who have always wanted to write, or do write but struggle to get their work out there, I would say just keep reminding yourself that you’re an artist and that every idea, every thought or dream you have could change a single person or a country and could end up making a huge difference -- no matter what you write about. You are an artist of words.
