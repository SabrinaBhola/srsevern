        Hi all! Very exciting news!
        <br/>
        Origin is now out and available to buy from Amazon Barnes and Noble!
        <br/><br/>
        For those who don’t know much about my new series, read below for a short

        description. Also, a big shout out to everyone who has shown their support and

        enthusiasm – it means a lot!
        <br/><br/>
        SHE’S FIRE...
        <br/>
        Viera Jackson is a free spirited woman, with a highly respected position in society, the

        respect of the residents of Belle Vue City and a job she has control of, she couldn’t ask for

        more...until notorious pirate, Kennedy Jackson J drops into her life...
        <br/><br/>
        HE’S THE SPARK...
        <br/>
        The last thing Ken predicted when he arrived at Belle Vue was that he would be behind bars

        with the captivating Deputy Jackson holding the key to his freedom. But unbeknownst to the

        town, Ken and Viera have met before; ten years ago they had fallen in love...

        The chemistry between them is still as intense as the day they’d met; reawakening a passion

        they thought had died long ago, still Viera struggles to fight her attraction for a man who

        left her long ago and Ken would do anything to claim her once more. But they both hold

        shameful secrets and darkness threatens any hope they have at happiness.
        <br/><br/>
