<h1>Series Announcement</h1>

Hello all, so a little about me...I have always had an unhealthy addiction to romance, mythological & fantasy books which (over the years) have accommodated sexy paranormal romance novels. With this love and passion finally becoming too much, I started my very own series which I will be posting a bit about each week to give you guys an idea of what it’s all about! That being said, I can reveal that my series is called <br /> ‘<span class="srsevern"> THE JACKSON J TALES</span>’.
<br/><br/>
Here’s a brief narrative on <span class="srsevern">THE JJ TALES</span> by yours truly...     <br/>
‘Set in an alternative industrialized civilization inspired by 19th century’s British Victorian era, the series revolves around Kennedy and Viera, a dangerously eccentric, highly explorative and fearless couple and the people they encounter along their adventures. Everything from gods, different dimensions, to creatures of myth lie in wait to test their strength as a pair and they will need all the skill, courage and heart to stand tall and battle their way through...as the legendary Jackson Js.’
