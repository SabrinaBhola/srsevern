In the process of writing Origin, I found myself listening to a variety of artists and songs that have helped me along the way that has inspired me, brought me to tears and made me chuckle. For me there’s no real way of describing my emotions when I reach a particularly difficult scene for a character(s), but that’s where music comes into play.
<br />
Like poetry, it manages to draw out a single indescribable emotion and explain it in a time of 3-4 minutes or less.
<br />
I also managed to find a song which immediately relates to one of my characters. I like to call it their ‘theme song’.4
<br />
So I figured it’d be fun to share with you guys just a few songs I feel relate to the characters of Origin each week, without giving away any details or spoilers about the plot.
I’m an anime fan, so don’t be baffled when you find I listen to anime songs...a lot of them are emotional and brilliant for battle scenes or love scenes (just putting it out there for my fellow anime lovers).
<br />
So let’s kick start this week with the novel as a whole. The song I definitely think captures and represents the style and setting in the JJ Tales has to be the ‘Radioactive’ cover by Pentatonix and Lindsey Stirling. They are unbelievably epic collaborating and Lindsey Stirling is one of the most talented and boss rock violinists I’ve discovered so far. Pentatonix stole my heart the first moment I heard their ‘Carol of the bells’ cover and I’ve not gone back since.
<br />
While I adore the original version of ‘Radioactive’ (by Imagine Dragons), this cover honestly fits the bill for Origin. Everything from the fashion, the musical instruments, the voices and of course, lyrics, depicts the first Jackson J novel sublimely. It is most definitely a perfect theme for Origin.

Heads up - Next post will feature more songs and more characters!!
