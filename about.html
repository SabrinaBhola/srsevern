            S.R. Severn was born in London, England and from a young age displayed signs of having a wild and creative imagination. She possessed a keen eye for detail and interest in art and books as a child, choosing to express herself thoroughly and effectively on paper than using her voice.
            <br /><br />
            At twelve, the first romance book she picked up was a Mills & Boon publication. Since then she has been dedicated to happy endings and true love. Romance books and writing is what defines her and remains to be one of her greatest joys and obsessions. She obtained an English Creative Writing degree at the University of Greenwich to further improve and professionalise her writing skills.
            <br /><br />
            To this very day, her imagination often takes her to safe and intense places (think Wonderland but crazier), often distracting her from reality, but she gets the ideas down on paper once she lands back to earth! She’s a Doctor Who, Marvel, DC and paranormal romance fan, having been inspired by the amazing works of J.R. Ward, Nalini Singh, Gena Showalter, Kresley Cole, Shiloh Walker and other notable authors in the paranormal romance world.

            Aside from being an author, S.R. is also an avid gamer, compulsive cleaner, recreational baker and part-time nutcase...but who isn’t?
