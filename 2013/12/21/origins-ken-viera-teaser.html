                Hey guys! Thought it’d be fun to post a teaser from the first book, it’s a first look at the main couple, Ken and Viera. Enjoy!

She’d missed him so much. And that reason alone had her resting her head against the bars, closing her eyes slowly and waiting.
<br/>Waiting for a kiss that might never happen.    <br/>
She felt his breath against her neck, against her ear and she held her breath. They stayed like that for a heartbeat, maybe more.
<br/>“Let me out of here, V.”<br/>
Viera’s eyes snapped open. She pulled away from him but not soon enough as his hand shot through the bars to flip her around.  He clasped her throat holding her against the cell roughly. He heard her sharp hiss and her hands came up to her throat, struggling to release his hold on her. He ignored her, swiftly disarming her of every piece of weaponry she owned by unbuckling her holster belt. The rope at her side was convenient and he used it to lope around her waist and tie her against the bars.
<br/> “You bastard!” She gasped, struggling to pull at the rope but failing as he had wound it through and around the bars level to her midriff.
“But seriously...what were you expecting?”
